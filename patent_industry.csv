An acoustic pickup produces an electrical signal with vibration of the conduit due to impact of the loose part, and background noise. A signal processor encodes the values of distinct parameters of the electrical signal such as amplitude, amplitude at particular frequencies, etc., in an ongoing manner, producing discrete output values. These outputs are coupled as inputs to a neural network with physical or logical neuron cells loaded with weighting factors affecting the strength and polarity of neural interconnections. The factors represent the acoustic signature of the loose part. Products of the input values and the weighting factors are summed to produce one or more neural network outputs, compared to a threshold. The sum normally varies randomly, but has a strong swing when the pattern is encountered, due to the factors emphasizing the pattern over background noise. The threshold comparison operates a display or alarm. The weighting factors are learned by repeating empirical tests and correlating the factors to the signal to minimize error."

No. WO95/22869 PCT Pub. Date Aug. 24, 1995The invention refers to a method and an apparatus for generating compressed colored video scenes. In conventional methods and apparatus of this kind the problem arises that a large number of color values is present for each scene. The large number of color values should be reduced such that a pleasant image appears for the viewer. In order to obtain this a RGB color space is spanned wherein all color values of all pixels of all individual images of one video scene are inserted. The RGB color space is divided in 256 color rectangular parallel epipeds, each color parallel epiped containing either the same number of pixels or the same number of color values. All color values in one color rectangular parallel epiped are replaced by a mean color value for this color rectangular parallel epiped. Using these mean color values the individual images of a scene are represented such that with the exception of the first image only a differential image to the previously shown image is generated, only such pixels being unequal 0 the difference thereof exceeding a predetermined threshold value. A data compression of the differential images is carried out. The compressed data are stored in a data memory. During reproduction the data are decompressed and reproduced on a screen under a clock control."

The method includes searching the MPEG-2 transport stream for a packet start code prefix indicating the start of a PES packet and storing the data associated with the PES packet into a buffer. If the PES packet is a video PES packet, the packet header is examined to determine if a PTS is present. If a PTS is present, the video data in the PES packet are examined during storage to the buffer to locate the first occurrence of a picture start code in the data. Once the first occurrence of a picture start code is located, a flag is set indicating the correspondence between the PTS and the identified picture start code. The video data remaining in the video PES packet is then stored to the buffer without further examination. The PES packet data are stored without examination if a PTS is not present. In either instance, the stored data are transmitted from the buffer to the video decoder in known lengths. If the PES packet is an audio PES packet, a current value of a system time clock is subtracted from a value of a first PTS contained in an audio PES packet to calculate an audio delay. The audio delay is then adjusted to account for audio decoding, audio transmission, and video decoding times. Audio data stored in the buffer are not enabled for delivery to an audio decoder until after the audio delay has elapsed."

In this case, a digitized image is divided into a number of range blocks (Ri, Ri+1) and into a number of domain blocks (Dj, Dk). A similar domain block is determined in relation to each range block. If necessary, in this process a transformation of a domain block is undertaken in order to map the domain block onto a range block. The assignment of the domain block to the range block including the transformation parameters represents the fractal code for the image. A reduced transformation matrix is set up to check convergence of the fractal code. The largest absolute eigenvalue of the transformation matrix is determined approximately. The entire method can be carried out in this case hierarchically. In a first approximation step, at least the row sum norm of each row of the reduced transformation matrix is checked. In further steps, further rows are combined to form square matrices of higher dimension. The latter are used to determine the largest absolute eigenvalues for the purpose of checking convergence."

Unrestricted, extemporaneous speech of a group of customers are digitized, analyzed in accordance with a PCM circuit, and characterized as a non-parametric set of speech feature vectors. The extemporaneous speech of the long distance telephone service user claiming the identity of a service customer via his card number is digitized and analyzed in a like manner. The identity of the user is verified by comparing, either during or after the call, the signals in accordance with an algorithm which compares a reference utterance of a known customer with input utterances from one or more unknown telephone service users, one of which users has claimed the identity of the customer. This comparison results in a decision to accept or reject the hypothesized identity. The identity hypothesis to be tested is thus derived from the calling card of the customer."

If the PES packet is a video PES packet, the packet header is examined to determine if a PTS is present. If a PTS is present, the video data in the PES packet are examined during storage to the buffer to locate the first occurrence of a picture start code in the data. Once the first occurrence of a picture start code is located, a flag is set indicating the correspondence between the PTS and the identified picture start code.

The manufacturing and test simulator (MTSIM) simulates manufacturing test and repair aspects of boards and multichip modules (MCMs) from design concept through manufacturing release to aid the designer in selecting appropriate trade-offs in the design for manufacturability and the design for testability. All simulation by the methods of the present invention applies manufacturing and test models down to the component level. The methods of the simulator include a new yield model for boards and MCMs which accounts for the clustering of solder defects. MTSIM models solder faults, manufacturing workmanship faults, component performance faults, and reliability faults. Fault probabilities for the circuit design are estimated based on the component type, the component functionality, and the assembly process used. Up to seven manufacturing test steps can be simulated by MTSIM. Test coverage models will support all commonly used manufacturing test methodologies, including visual inspection, in-circuit test, IEEE 1149.1 boundary scan, selftest, diagnostics, and burn-in. Pareto and iterative 'what-if' analysis may be used to locate particular enhancements which most benefit the manufacturability and testability of the product."

However, this means a higher expense during the recognition of the patterns, since the individual paths of the Viterbi algorithm have to be normed to the current accumulated probabilities in the path with respect to their probabilities, in order to be able to compare them. The inventive method offers the advantage that only the time segment of the measurement signal also containing the pattern has to be analyzed. An increased probability of a hit is thereby reconciled with a lower computing expense."

Each user is able to create a personalized list of billers by merely speaking and recording the name of the biller. Each spoken biller name for each user is recorded within the system. Each spoken biller name for each user is recorded by the system and used as confirmation prompts in a bill paying session by that particular user. In this way, the system of the present invention allows each user to dynamically maintain a customized list of biller names recorded in the user's own voice. The recording of biller names is carried out as part of a initialization or setup procedure. To use the system, the user or billee dials the bill payment systems and selects bill payment mode. With the system in bill payment mode, the user selects whether a one-time or recurring bill is to be paid. For either type of bill, the user indicates both the merchant and the amount of the bill to be paid. In the case of a one-time bill, the user specifies the date on which the bill is to be paid. Conversely, in the case of a recurring bill, the user specifies a start date and an end date, specifying the period in which multiple bills are to be paid to the particular merchant. The bill payment system of the present invention also includes capabilities for reviewing, changing or cancelling payments, as well as modifying and updating the user's custom list of merchants."
