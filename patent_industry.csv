The reliability analysis comprises digraph models that determine target events created by hardware failures human actions, and other factors affecting the system operation. The reliability analysis contains a wealth of human expertise information that is used to build automatic diagnostic routines and which provides a knowledge base that can be used to solve other artificial intelligence problems."

Goals and their priorities are indicated by the user, and allocation decisions are made in the STM, while candidate associations of resources are supplied by the LTM based on the association strength (reliability). Weights are automatically assigned to the network links based on the frequency and relative success of exercising those links in the previous allocation decisions. Accumulation of allocation history in the form of an associative network in the LTM reduces computational demands on subsequent allocations. For this purpose, the network automatically partitions itself into strongly associated high reliability packets, allowing fast approximate computation and display of allocation solutions satisfying the overall reliability and other user-imposed constraints. System performance improves in time due to modification of network parameters and partitioning criteria based on the performance feedback."

It comprises generating the linear approximation of a limit-state-function, g(x) about the median, mean point, or mode of random variables, x of g(x). g(x) is defined so that g(x)f0 denotes a failure set. The Most-Probable-Point-Locus (MPPL) of g1, MPPL1, is constructed by the steps of: i) identifying the mode of x; ii) identifying the MPP of g1(x)=c, where c is an arbitrary constant, and iii) constructing said MPPL1 by connecting said mode of x from step i), above, and the MPPs corresponding to different c's from step ii), above. A quadratic search algorithm is to identify point MPP1, the intersection of MPPL1 and g(x)=0, based on the following convergence criteria: 1. g(+E,uns x+EE ) = 0 and, <IMAGE> The process is then stopped, unless the convergence criteria are not satisfied. g2, the linear approximation of the limit-state-function, g(x) about MPP1 is generated. MPP21, the Most-Probable-Point of g2(x)=0 is located. The approximate MPPL of g2, MPPL2, is constructed by connecting the mode and the MPP21. The quadratic search algorithm is used to identify point MPP2,, the intersection of MPPL2 and g(x)=0 based on the convergence criteria. gf(x) is updated, where j=2, 3, . . . , m, where m is the total number of steps required for convergence."

The card number is used to access a central data base through the telephone network, wherein a voice verification template is retrieved corresponding to the entered card number. The voice verification contains various samples of the authorized user's voice stating selected words, phrases and/or numbers. Once the proper voice verification template is retrieved, the system prompts the user to state one of the words, phrases and/or numbers contained within the voice verification template. The word, phrase and/or numbers stated in response to the prompt is compared with the voice verification template. If the stated words match the template, the user is considered to be the authorized user and the card is validated. If the stated words do not match the voice verification template, the user may or may not be denied authorization depending upon the use of the card and the financial stake being placed in the use of the card."
