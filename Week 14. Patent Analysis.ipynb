According to this design fuzzy controller is a device which operates at the level of fuzzy pattern processing where each control task is expressed through the attributes of fuzzy patterns (syntax and content, domain and clearness measure), and the elementary cognitive activities which the human performs with these patterns such as: recognition, generation, assessment, association, pattern matching, approximation, etc. The fuzzy controller utilizes a new scheme for approximate reasoning with fuzzy patterns called the Clearness Transformation Rule of Inference (CTRI). This mechanism offers a spectrum of advantages broadening the functional Intelligence of the controller to handle complex human rusks, improving performance and accuracy of the controller and reduces the computational requirements.

False acceptances of a speaker cause serious problems but so do frequent false rejections in view of the annoyance caused. Some of the problems of speaker verification are reduced in the invention by forming Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for each of a number of words using features of utterances of these words from a large number of speakers. These models are known as world models. In addition, for every person whose speech is to be recognized, one HMM is formed for each of the words as uttered by that person. These models are known as personal models. In verification, a person is prompted to repeat a string of isolated or connected words (15) and features from each of these words are extracted (16). Next, the probabilities that these features could have been generated by the world models for these words and by the personal model of that person are calculated, respectively (17 and 18) and these probabilities are compared (19) for each word. A decision (23) on verification is based on a poll (22) of these comparisons.\"],\n [{\n            'v': 49,\n            'f': \"49\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 49522156,\n            'f': \"49522156\",\n        },\n{\n            'v': 1991,\n            'f': \"1991\",\n        },\n\"US\",\n\"G10L  15/197\",\n{\n            'v': 28.23,\n            'f': \"28.23\",\n        },\n\"Method and apparatus for recognizing spoken words in a speech signal\",\n\"In the recognition of coherent speech, language models are favourably used to increase the reliability of recognition, which models, for example, take into account the probabilities of word combinations, especially of word pairs.

Such feedback enhances the signal-to-noise ratio and resembles the coupling between the different sections of the basilar membrane of the cochlear. The output of the filter bank is a two-dimensional frequency-time representation of the original signal. A second set of filters which takes as input two-dimensional signals, detects the presence of elementary tonotopic features such as the onset, rise, fall and frequency of any significant tones in a speech signal. A third set of filters detects any contrasts in the elementary features at various levels of resolution. After such filtering, a neural network is employed to learn patterns formed from the multi-resolution contrasts in the identified features so that the system recognizes symbols from an input signal that is continuous in time.

The system optionally includes an actuator for effecting the environment of operation, allowing closed-loop feedback operation and automated learning.\"]],\n        columns: [[\"number\", \"index\"], [\"number\", \"appln_id\"], [\"number\", \"earliest_filing_year\"], [\"string\", \"person_ctry_code\"], [\"string\", \"cpc_class_symbol\"], [\"number\", \"nace2_code\"], [\"string\", \"appln_title\"], [\"string\", \"abstract\"]],\n        columnOptions: [{\"width\": \"1px\", \"className\": \"index_column\"}],\n        rowsPerPage: 25,\n        helpUrl: \"https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/data_table.ipynb\",\n        suppressOutputScrolling: true,\n        minimumWidth: undefined,\n      });\n\n      function appendQuickchartButton(parentElement) {\n        let quickchartButtonContainerElement = document.createElement('div');\n        quickchartButtonContainerElement.innerHTML = `\n<div id=\"df-9428b550-4507-46b9-8c5a-c225d423c8cc\">\n  <button class=\"colab-df-quickchart\" onclick=\"quickchart('df-9428b550-4507-46b9-8c5a-c225d423c8cc')\"\n            title=\"Suggest charts\"\n            style=\"display:none;\">\n    \n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n     width=\"24px\">\n    <g>\n        <path d=\"M19 3H5c-1.1 0-2 .9-2 2v14c0 1.1.9 2 2 2h14c1.1 0 2-.9 2-2V5c0-1.1-.9-2-2-2zM9 17H7v-7h2v7zm4 0h-2V7h2v10zm4 0h-2v-4h2v4z\"/>\n    </g>\n</svg>\n  </button>\n  \n<style>\n  .colab-df-quickchart {\n      --bg-color: #E8F0FE;\n      --fill-color: #1967D2;\n      --hover-bg-color: #E2EBFA;\n      --hover-fill-color: #174EA6;\n      --disabled-fill-color: #AAA;\n      --disabled-bg-color: #DDD;\n  }\n\n  [theme=dark] .colab-df-quickchart {\n      --bg-color: #3B4455;\n      --fill-color: #D2E3FC;\n      --hover-bg-color: #434B5C;\n      --hover-fill-color: #FFFFFF;\n      --disabled-bg-color: #3B4455;\n      --disabled-fill-color: #666;\n  }\n\n  .colab-df-quickchart {\n    background-color: var(--bg-color);\n    border: none;\n    border-radius: 50%;\n    cursor: pointer;\n    display: none;\n    fill: var(--fill-color);\n    height: 32px;\n    padding: 0;\n    width: 32px;\n  }\n\n  .colab-df-quickchart:hover {\n    background-color: var(--hover-bg-color);\n    box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n    fill: var(--button-hover-fill-color);\n  }\n\n  .colab-df-quickchart-complete:disabled,\n  .colab-df-quickchart-complete:disabled:hover {\n    background-color: var(--disabled-bg-color);\n    fill: var(--disabled-fill-color);\n    box-shadow: none;\n  }\n\n  .colab-df-spinner {\n    border: 2px solid var(--fill-color);\n    border-color: transparent;\n    border-bottom-color: var(--fill-color);\n    animation:\n      spin 1s steps(1) infinite;\n  }\n\n  @keyframes spin {\n    0% {\n      border-color: transparent;\n      border-bottom-color: var(--fill-color);\n      border-left-color: var(--fill-color);\n    }\n    20% {\n      border-color: transparent;\n      border-left-color: var(--fill-color);\n      border-top-color: var(--fill-color);\n    }\n    30% {\n      border-color: transparent;\n      border-left-color: var(--fill-color);\n      border-top-color: var(--fill-color);\n      border-right-color: var(--fill-color);\n    }\n    40% {\n      border-color: transparent;\n      border-right-color: var(--fill-color);\n      border-top-color: var(--fill-color);\n    }\n    60% {\n      border-color: transparent;\n      border-right-color: var(--fill-color);\n    }\n    80% {\n      border-color: transparent;\n      border-right-color: var(--fill-color);\n      border-bottom-color: var(--fill-color);\n    }\n    90% {\n      border-color: transparent;\n      border-bottom-color: var(--fill-color);\n    }\n  }\n</style>\n\n  <script>\n    async function quickchart(key) {\n      const quickchartButtonEl =\n        document.querySelector('#' + key + ' button');\n      quickchartButtonEl.disabled = true;  // To prevent multiple clicks.\n      quickchartButtonEl.classList.add('colab-df-spinner');\n      try {\n        const charts = await google.colab.kernel.invokeFunction(\n            'suggestCharts', [key], {});\n      } catch (error) {\n        console.error('Error during call to suggestCharts:', error);\n      }\n      quickchartButtonEl.classList.remove('colab-df-spinner');\n      quickchartButtonEl.classList.add('colab-df-quickchart-complete');\n    }\n    (() => {\n      let quickchartButtonEl =\n        document.querySelector('#df-9428b550-4507-46b9-8c5a-c225d423c8cc button');\n      quickchartButtonEl.style.display =\n        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?
