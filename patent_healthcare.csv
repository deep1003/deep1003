52886028;1990;"JP";"Y10S 706/902";"26.2";"Fuzzy backward reasoning device";"A sequential type Fuzzy backward reasoning device is disclosed, which is capable of performing computation progressively every time a feature quantity is observed to update reasoning, and of performing the reasoning even if the order of observations is arbitrary, by providing means for performing the sequential reasoning instead of batch type reasoning means, and feedback means for feeding back a reasoned result. Additionally, a target recognition device is disclosed, which is capable of computing the reliability of a recognized result on a target and outputting the same as a numerical value, by obtaining another recognition information even if there is not obtained any information concerning the target, using said sequential type Fuzzy backward reasoning device."
