The invention relates to the design of an Intelligent system which implements a decision-making procedure based on approximation, association and reasoning with fuzzy patterns and their clearness assessments rather than the use of Max-Min computation over fuzzy relational matrices usually applied in approximate reasoning procedures in similar systems. According to this design fuzzy controller is a device which operates at the level of fuzzy pattern processing where each control task is expressed through the attributes of fuzzy patterns (syntax and content, domain and clearness measure), and the elementary cognitive activities which the human performs with these patterns such as: recognition, generation, assessment, association, pattern matching, approximation, etc. The fuzzy controller utilizes a new scheme for approximate reasoning with fuzzy patterns called the Clearness Transformation Rule of Inference (CTRI). This mechanism offers a spectrum of advantages broadening the functional Intelligence of the controller to handle complex human rusks, improving performance and accuracy of the controller and reduces the computational requirements. The fuzzy controller presented in the invention can be applied in general engineering practice, financial, medical, process control, pattern recognition and other areas requiring knowledge-based behaviour in decision making."

The invention relates to the design of an Intelligent system which implements a decision-making procedure based on approximation, association and reasoning with fuzzy patterns and their clearness assessments rather than the use of Max-Min computation over fuzzy relational matrices usually applied in approximate reasoning procedures in similar systems. According to this design fuzzy controller is a device which operates at the level of fuzzy pattern processing where each control task is expressed through the attributes of fuzzy patterns (syntax and content, domain and clearness measure), and the elementary cognitive activities which the human performs with these patterns such as: recognition, generation, assessment, association, pattern matching, approximation, etc. The fuzzy controller utilizes a new scheme for approximate reasoning with fuzzy patterns called the Clearness Transformation Rule of Inference (CTRI). This mechanism offers a spectrum of advantages broadening the functional Intelligence of the controller to handle complex human rusks, improving performance and accuracy of the controller and reduces the computational requirements. The fuzzy controller presented in the invention can be applied in general engineering practice, financial, medical, process control, pattern recognition and other areas requiring knowledge-based behaviour in decision making."

False acceptances of a speaker cause serious problems but so do frequent false rejections in view of the annoyance caused. Some of the problems of speaker verification are reduced in the invention by forming Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for each of a number of words using features of utterances of these words from a large number of speakers. These models are known as world models. In addition, for every person whose speech is to be recognized, one HMM is formed for each of the words as uttered by that person. These models are known as personal models. In verification, a person is prompted to repeat a string of isolated or connected words (15) and features from each of these words are extracted (16). Next, the probabilities that these features could have been generated by the world models for these words and by the personal model of that person are calculated, respectively (17 and 18) and these probabilities are compared (19) for each word. A decision (23) on verification is based on a poll (22) of these comparisons."

Such feedback enhances the signal-to-noise ratio and resembles the coupling between the different sections of the basilar membrane of the cochlear. The output of the filter bank is a two-dimensional frequency-time representation of the original signal. A second set of filters which takes as input two-dimensional signals, detects the presence of elementary tonotopic features such as the onset, rise, fall and frequency of any significant tones in a speech signal. A third set of filters detects any contrasts in the elementary features at various levels of resolution. After such filtering, a neural network is employed to learn patterns formed from the multi-resolution contrasts in the identified features so that the system recognizes symbols from an input signal that is continuous in time.

Detection of breathing is performed by low-pass filtering the rectified and filtered signal, and adaptive thresholding of the low-pass filtered signal. A similar but separate technique is used to detect heartbeats. In one embodiment, reliability of detection is enhanced by reducing the number of speckles of light applied to the photodetector to approximately 50%, thereby to maximize modal noise current. In another embodiment the photodetector has two halves separately illuminated by approximately two-thirds of the light from the optical fiber waveguide. Outputs of the photodetector halves are applied to the positive and negative inputs of an operational amplifier, whereby common mode noise is eliminated and modal noise current and therefore sensitivity of modal noise detection increased."

No. WO93/23689 PCT Pub. Date Nov. 25, 1993The invention concerns a control system (10) for changing automatic gears (3) that operates according to fuzzy logic methods. All the fuzzy-production rules are divided into at least three sections: a set of basic rules to determine the gear-changing point in a consumption-oriented driving style, a set of adaptation rules to modify the set of basic rules depending on a current driving style and an identification set of rules for classifying the driver according to his/her driving style. By way of a supplementary set of adaptation rules the set of basic rules can be additionally modified according to a current driving condition. Individual function blocks (11 to 15) operate preferably according to the same inference mechanism. Gamma operators are used in order to approximate as closely as possible human behavior. A process is proposed for generating membership functions to determine a running condition by fuzzy-production rules. In a preferred embodiment the adaptive gear-changing behavior is activated by forming offsets. Priorities are allotted to the rules especially for reasons of safety and reliability."
